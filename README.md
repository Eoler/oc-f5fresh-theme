# F5fresh
Starter development template for building [Zurb Foundation 5](https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3/) themed [OctoberCMS](//octobercms.com/) sites.

Includes:
- latest Foundation 5 [source from official Bower repository](https://github.com/zurb/bower-foundation)
- style guide layout with most Foundation UI components
- [GulpJS-based build system](https://nystudio107.com/blog/a-gulp-workflow-for-frontend-development-automation) for development and production
- [NPM-based config system](https://nystudio107.com/blog/a-better-package-json-for-the-frontend) for development and production


## Installation
Add the theme to existing project while logged into OctoberCMS account online,
or interactively by searching it inside Settings/System/Updates/Themes in backend,
or with the following command-line instructions inside *project root*:
```
php artisan theme:install castus.f5fresh f5fresh
php artisan theme:use f5fresh
```

## One-time Development Environment Setup
Install [NodeJS and Node Package Manager](https://nodejs.org/en/) globally (LTS version required, Gulp v3 is incompatible with NodeJS v12+).
Run the following command-line instructions inside *theme root*:
```
npm install --global gulp-cli bower
npm i
```
Integrating build process into OctoberCMS project is easy - copy (or merge into existing) files into *project root*:
```
gulpfile.js
package.json
```
Adjust `paths.root` configuration variable to **themes/castus-f5fresh/** and start using command-line tasks from *project root*. 

## Using and Editing
Check [styleguide/default layout](https://github.com/Eoler/oc-f5fresh-theme/blob/master/layouts/styleguide/default.htm)
for example HTML page structure and mandatory includes.
Custom styles example source is in [assets/scss/styleguide SCSS](https://github.com/Eoler/oc-f5fresh-theme/blob/master/assets/scss/styleguide.scss),
scripts in [assets/es6/styleguide JS](https://github.com/Eoler/oc-f5fresh-theme/blob/master/assets/es6/styleguide.js).
Development changes can be automated with command-line instruction from configured Gulpfile (project or theme) *build root*:
```
gulp watch
```
Build versioned, optimized, minified, autoprefixed assets with command-line instruction:
```
gulp upbuild --production
```

## Customizing Foundation
Global Foundation styling parameters should be overriden in
[assets/scss/_settings553 SCSS](https://github.com/Eoler/oc-f5fresh-theme/blob/master/assets/scss/_settings553.scss).

Comment out unwanted styles and scripts for leaner and faster Foundation custom build:
- [assets/scss/foundation553 SCSS](https://github.com/Eoler/oc-f5fresh-theme/blob/master/assets/scss/foundation553.scss)
- [assets/es6/foundation553 JS](https://github.com/Eoler/oc-f5fresh-theme/blob/master/assets/es6/foundation553.js)
